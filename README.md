Android Wave Recorder is a lightweight library written in Kotlin to record audio files with WAVE (WAV due to its filename extension) format in Android. It's very memory efficient and easy to use library with recording customizations.

### Download
Step 1. Add this in your root (Project) build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```gradle
allprojects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }
```
Step 2. Add the dependency
```gradle
dependencies{
    implementation 'com.github.squti:Android-Wave-Recorder:1.5.0'
}
```
### Permission
Add these permissions into your `AndroidManifest.xml` and [request for them in Android 6.0+](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### Usage
Pass in the path of the output file to `WaveRecorder` class and call `startRecording()` like this:
```kotlin
/**
 * This path points to application cache directory.
 * you could change it based on your usage
 */
val filePath:String = externalCacheDir?.absolutePath + "/audioFile.wav"

val waveRecorder = WaveRecorder(filePath)
waveRecorder.startRecording()

```
To stop recording call `stopRecording()` function:
```kotlin
waveRecorder.stopRecording()

```

To pause and resume recording you could use `pauseRecording()` and `resumeRecording()` functions:
```kotlin
//Pause
waveRecorder.pauseRecording()

//Resume
waveRecorder.resumeRecording()

```

To activate `Noise Suppressor` you could set `noiseSuppressorActive` to true:
```kotlin
waveRecorder.noiseSuppressorActive = true

```

To listen to audio amplitude during recording you need to register a listener to `onAmplitudeListener`:
```kotlin
waveRecorder.onAmplitudeListener = {
    Log.i(TAG, "Amplitude : $it")
}
```

To listen to recording state changes **(RECORDING, STOP and PAUSE)** you need to register a listener to `onStateChangeListener`:
```kotlin
waveRecorder.onStateChangeListener = {
    when (it) {
        RecorderState.RECORDING -> TODO()
        RecorderState.STOP -> TODO()
        RecorderState.PAUSE -> TODO()
    }
}
```
### Configuration
The default configuration for recording audio is like so: 

| Property | Value |
| :---: | :---: |
| sampleRate | 16000 |
| channels | AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_MONO |
| audioEncoding | AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT |

But you could change it using `waveConfig` property in `WaveRecorder` class based on your usage. This is an example:
```kotlin
val waveRecorder = WaveRecorder(filePath)
waveRecorder.waveConfig.sampleRate = 44100
waveRecorder.waveConfig.channels = AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_STEREO
waveRecorder.waveConfig.audioEncoding = AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_8BIT
waveRecorder.startRecording()
```
_Note: Wrong configuration may impacts output quality_
